        <h1>The Story Behind Harvey's Name</h1>

        <p>It's no secret that names carry with them stories, legacies, and often, a glimpse into the inspirations that lead pawrents to choose them. For our little fluffball, Harvey Doodle, the tale behind his name is as interesting as it gets!</p>
        
        <p>The name "Harvey" wasn't just a random pick from a list of popular dog names. Instead, it was a nod to the charismatic and astute lawyer from the famed TV show, "Suits" – Harvey Specter. Known for his impeccable style, sharp wit, and unwavering confidence, Harvey Specter was a force to reckon with in the legal world of New York City. Our pawrents, being avid fans of the series, saw similar traits of charm and intelligence in their furry companion and felt that "Harvey" was a fitting name for him.</p>

        <p>Every time Harvey Doodle strikes a pose or turns on his puppy-dog eyes, one can't help but wonder if he's channeling his inner Harvey Specter, ready to 'close the deal'—be it a new toy, treat, or just some extra snuggles from his pawrents. Regardless, the name suits him perfectly, pun intended!</p>
